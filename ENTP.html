  <div class="strength"><hr><p3>Strengths:</p3><hr></div>
<p2>•	Knowledgeable </p2><p>
o	 ENTPs rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the ENTP personality type just find it fascinating.
</p><p2>•	Quick Thinkers </p2><p>
o	 ENTPs have tremendously flexible minds and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit.
</p><p2>•	Original </p2><p>
o	 Having little attachment to tradition, ENTP personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, ENTPs respond with unabashed glee.
</p><p2>•	Excellent Brainstormers </p2><p>
o	 Nothing is quite as enjoyable to ENTPs as analysing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work and presenting ever more possibilities, ENTPs are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.
</p><p2>•	Charismatic </p2><p>
o	 People with the ENTP personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.
</p><p2>•	Energetic </p2><p>
o	 When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, ENTPs can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.

</p><div class="weakness"><hr>
  <p3>Weaknesses:</p3><hr></div><p2>
•	Very Argumentative </p2><p>
o	 If there’s anything ENTPs enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which ENTP personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.
</p><p2>•	Insensitive </p2><p>
o	 Being so rational, ENTPs often misjudge other feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.
</p><p2>•	Intolerant </p2><p>
o	 Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, ENTPs are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with.
</p><p2>•	Can Find It Difficult to Focus </p2><p>
o	 The same flexibility that allows ENTPs to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for ENTPs, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.
</p><p2>•	Dislike Practical Matters </p2><p>
o	 ENTPs are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, ENTP personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.

</p>
<div class="career"><hr><p3>Career Paths</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	Focus on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems.
</p><p>•	ENTPs love flexing their mental muscles.
</p><p>•	Entrepreneurship, engineering, evening acting and photography, anything that accommodates their strengths and weaknesses.
</p><p>•	Don’t like managing others.
</p><p>•	Make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, system analysts and scientists. Could thrive to be sales representatives. Freelance consultants or software engineers.
</p>
<div class="relationship"><hr><p3>Relationships</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	Never ending stream of innovations and idea when it comes to romantic relationships.
</p><p>•	ENTPs test their partners’ limits for this kind of potential, pushing boundaries and traditions, looking for open-mindedness and spontaneity.
</p><p>•	Dating ENTP personalities is hardly a boring experience due to their creativity and enthusiasm.
</p><p>•	ENTPs relationship can be very full on and may cause their partner to be worn down.
</p><p>•	Approach a more developed relationship much like the same way in which they approach academia.
</p><p>•	Have emotional obliviousness.
</p><p>•	When talking about their emotions to their partners they may appear to be harsh when that’s not the intent.
</p><p>•	May also ignore their partners’ feelings altogether, instead immersing themselves entirely in some distant idea or opportunity.
