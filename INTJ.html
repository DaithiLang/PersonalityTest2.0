  <div class="strength"><hr><p3>Strengths:</p3><hr></div>
<p2>•	Quick, Imaginative and Strategic Mind  </p2><p>
o	INTJs pride themselves on their minds, taking every opportunity to improve their knowledge, and
 this shows in the strength and flexibility of their strategic thinking. Insatiably curious and always
 up for an intellectual challenge, INTJs can see things from many perspectives. INTJs use their creativity
 and imagination not so much for artistry, but for planning contingencies and courses of action for all
 possible scenarios.</p>
<p2>•	High Self-Confidence </p2><p>
o	INTJs trust their rationalism above all else, so when they come to a conclusion, they have no reason
 to doubt their findings. This creates an honest, direct style of communication that isn’t held back by 
 perceived social roles or expectations. When INTJs are right, they’re right, and no amount of politicking
 or hand-holding is going to change that fact – whether it’s correcting a person, a process, or themselves,
 they’d have it no other way.</p><p2>
•	Independent and Decisive </p2><p>
o	This creativity, logic and confidence come together to form individuals who stand on their own and 
take responsibility for their own actions. Authority figures do not impress INTJs, nor do social 
conventions or tradition, and no matter how popular something is, if they have a better idea, INTJs 
will stand against anyone they have to in a bid to have it changed. Either an idea is the most rational
 or it’s wrong, and INTJs will apply this to their arguments as well as their own behaviour, staying calm
 and detached from these sometimes emotionally charged conflicts. INTJs will only be swayed by those who
 follow suit.</p><p2>
•	Hard-working and determined  </p2><p>
o	If something piques their interest, INTJs can be astonishingly dedicated to their work, putting in
 long hours and intense effort to see an idea through. INTJs are incredibly efficient, and if tasks meet
 the criteria of furthering a goal, they will find a way to consolidate and accomplish those tasks. 
 However, this drive for efficiency can also lead to a sort of elaborate laziness, wherein INTJs find 
 ways to bypass seeming redundancies which don’t seem to require a great deal of thought – this can be 
 risky, as sometimes double-checking one’s work is the standard for a reason.</p><p2>
•	Open-minded</p2><p> 
o	All this rationalism leads to a very intellectually receptive personality type, as INTJs stay open 
to new ideas, supported by logic, even if (and sometimes especially if) they prove INTJs’ previous 
conceptions wrong. When presented with unfamiliar territory, such as alternate lifestyles, INTJs tend to
 apply their receptiveness and independence, and aversion to rules and traditions, to these new ideas as
 well, resulting in fairly liberal social senses.</p><p2>
•	Jacks-of-all-Trades </p2><p>
o	INTJs’ open-mindedness, determination, independence, confidence and strategic abilities create
 individuals who are capable of doing anything they set their minds to. Excelling at analysing anything 
 life throws their way, INTJs are able to reverse-engineer the underlying methodology of almost any system
 and apply the concepts that are exposed wherever needed. INTJs tend to have their pick of professions,
 from IT architects to political masterminds.
</p><div class="weakness"><hr>
  <p3>Weaknesses:</p3><hr></div><p2>
•	Arrogant </p2><p>
o	 INTJs are perfectly capable of carrying their confidence too far, falsely believing that they’ve resolved
 all the pertinent issues of a matter and closing themselves off to the opinions of those they believe to
 be intellectually inferior. Combined with their irreverence for social conventions, INTJs can be brutally
 insensitive in making their opinions of others all too clear.</p><p2>
•	Judgmental </p2><p>
o	 INTJs tend to have complete confidence in their thought process, because rational arguments are almost
 by definition, correct – at least in theory. In practice, emotional considerations and history are hugely 
 influential, and a weak point for INTJs is that they brand these factors and those who embrace them as
 illogical, dismissing them and considering their proponents to be stuck in some baser mode of thought, 
 making it all but impossible to be heard.</p><p2>
•	Overly analytical </p2><p>
o	 A recurring theme with INTJs is their analytical prowess, but this strength can fall painfully short
 where logic doesn’t rule – such as with human relationships. When their critical minds and sometimes 
 neurotic level of perfectionism (often the case with Turbulent INTJs) are applied to other people, all 
 but the steadiest of friends will likely need to make some distance, too often permanently.</p><p2>
•	Loathe highly structured environments </p2><p>
o	 Blindly following precedents and rules without understanding them is distasteful to INTJs, and they 
disdain even more authority figures who blindly uphold those laws and rules without understanding their 
intent. Anyone who prefers the status quo for its own sake, or who values stability and safety over 
self-determination, is likely to clash with INTJ personality types. Whether it’s the law of the land or 
simple social convention, this aversion applies equally, often making life more difficult than it needs 
to be.</p><p2>
•	Clueless in romance </p2><p>
o	 This antipathy to rules and tendency to over-analyse and be judgmental, even arrogant, all adds up
 to a personality type that is often clueless in dating. Having a new relationship last long enough for 
 INTJs to apply the full force of their analysis on their potential partner’s thought processes and 
 behaviours can be challenging. Trying harder in the ways that INTJs know best can only make things worse,
 and it’s unfortunately common for them to simply give up the search. Ironically, this is when they’re at 
 their best, and most likely to attract a partner.
</p>
<div class="career"><hr><p3>Career Paths</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	Start off slow, but once repetition kicks in they start to understand what is being done – automate routine or mind-numbing tasks</p><p>
•	Works better alone or in small groups</p><p>
•	Lone wolf - Mechanical or software engineers, Lawyers or freelance consultants.</p><p>
•	Loath anyone who get work through social prowess and political connections.</p><p>
•	Have exceptionally high standards, and if a colleague or supervisor is incompetent or ineffective, respect will be lost instantly and permanently. </p><p>
•	Demand progress and evolution, new challenges and theories through their career.</p><p>
•	Later in careers they look for more active strategic positions, project managers, system engineers, marketing strategists, system analysts and military strategists.
</p>
<div class="relationship"><hr><p3>Relationships</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	INTJ’s have a specific person in mind when it comes to criteria. The person needs to tick all the boxes for that person to be accepted. </p><p>
•	In a relationship they set out milestones and objectives in which to be completed, but these don’t always go to plan due to human nature.</p><p>
•	INTJ’s are brilliantly intellectual, developing a world in their heads that is perfect than reality. People entering this world need to fit this fantasy, and it can be incredibly difficult for INTJ’s to find someone up to the task. </p><p>
•	Needless to say, finding a compatible partner is the most significant challenge most INTJs will face in life.</p><p>
•	INTJs seek strong, deep relationships, and trust their knowledge and logic to ensure that their partner is satisfied, both intellectually and physically.
