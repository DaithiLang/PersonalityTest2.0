  <div class="strength"><hr><p3>Strengths:</p3><hr></div>
<p2>•	Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers </p2><p>
o	 People with the INTP personality type view the world as a big, complex machine, and recognize that as with any machine, all parts are interrelated. INTPs excel in analysing these connections, seeing how seemingly unrelated factors tie in with each other in ways that bewilder most other personality types.</p>
<p2>•	Imaginative and Original </p2><p>
o	 These connections are the product of an unrelenting imagination – INTPs’ ideas may seem counter-intuitive at a glance, and may never even see the light of day, but they will always prove remarkable innovations.</p><p2>
•	Open-Minded </p2><p>
o	 INTPs couldn’t make these connections if they thought they knew it all – they are highly receptive to alternate theories, so long as they’re supported by logic and facts. In more subjective matters like social norms and traditions, INTPs are usually fairly liberal, with a "none of my business" sort of attitude – peoples’ ideas are what matter.</p><p2>
•	Enthusiastic  </p2><p>
o	 When a new idea piques their interest, INTPs can be very enthusiastic – they are a reserved personality type, but if another person shares an interest, they can be downright excited about discussing it. More likely though, the only outward evidence of this enthusiasm will be INTPs’ silent pacing or their staring into the distance.</p><p2>
•	Objective</p2><p> 
o	 INTPs’ analysis, creativity and open-mindedness aren’t the tools of some quest for ideology or emotional validation. Rather, it’s as though people with the INTP personality type are a conduit for the truths around them, so far as they can be expressed, and they are proud of this role as theoretical mediator.</p><p2>
•	Honest and Straightforward </p2><p>
o	 To know one thing and say another would be terribly disingenuous – INTPs don’t often go around intentionally hurting feelings, but they believe that the truth is the most important factor, and they expect that to be appreciated and reciprocated.
</p><div class="weakness"><hr>
  <p3>Weaknesses:</p3><hr></div><p2>
•	Very Private and Withdrawn </p2><p>
o	 While INTPs’ intellectualism yields many insights into their surroundings, their surroundings are ironically considered an intrusion on their thoughts. This is especially true with people – INTPs are quite shy in social settings. More complicated situations such as parties exacerbate this, but even close friends struggle to get into INTPs’ hearts and minds.</p><p2>
•	Insensitive </p2><p>
o	 Oftentimes INTP personalities get so caught up in their logic that they forget any kind of emotional consideration – they dismiss subjectivity as irrational and tradition as an attempt to bar much-needed progress. Purely emotional situations are often utterly puzzling to INTPs, and their lack of timely sympathy can easily offend.</p><p2>
•	Absent-minded </p2><p>
o	 When INTPs’ interest is captured, their absence goes beyond social matters to include the rest of the physical world. INTPs become forgetful, missing even the obvious if it’s unrelated to their current infatuation, and they can even forget their own health, skipping meals and sleep as they muse.</p><p2>
•	Condescending </p2><p>
o	 Attempts at connecting with others are often worse than INTPs’ withdrawal. People with the INTP personality type take pride in their knowledge and rationale, and enjoy sharing their ideas, but in trying to explain how they got from A to B to Z, they can get frustrated, sometimes simplifying things to the point of insult as they struggle to gauge their conversation partners’ perspective. The ultimate insult comes as INTPs give up with a dismissive "never mind".</p><p2>
•	Loathe Rules and Guidelines </p2><p>
o	 These social struggles are partly a product of INTPs’ desire to bypass the rules, of social conduct and otherwise. While this attitude helps INTPs’ strength of unconventional creativity, it also causes them to reinvent the wheel constantly and to shun security in favour of autonomy in ways that can compromise both.</p><p2>
•	Second-Guess Themselves </p2><p>
o	 INTPs remain so open to new information that they often never commit to a decision at all. This applies to their own skills as well – INTP personalities know that as they practice, they improve, and any work they do is second-best to what they could do. Unable to settle for this, INTPs sometimes delay their output indefinitely with constant revisions, sometimes even quitting before they ever begin.
</p>
<div class="career"><hr><p3>Career Paths</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	INTPs are solitary, eccentric and independent – not desirable for corporate positions.</p><p>
•	Struggle finding careers that meet their needs, but what they do bring, qualities in much higher demand, are creativity, a passion for theoretical methods and ideas.</p><p>
•	Interests in exploring and building models for underlying principles and ideas – Natural mathematicians, systems analysts and career scientists – physics.</p><p>
•	Self-driven and have very high personal standards – “good enough” is never good enough.</p><p>
•	Do not thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction.</p><p>
•	Work as business analysts and corporate strategists is well suited to INTPs, but they can also move things forward as data analysts, mechanical, electrical and software engineers, and even as technical writers and journalists, provided the field is interesting enough.
</p>
<div class="relationship"><hr><p3>Relationships</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	INTPs take their relationships seriously.</p><p>
•	It’s a challenge for them in getting to know new people.</p><p>
•	They prove themselves repeatedly to be surprisingly loyal.</p><p>
•	INTPs don’t need much work in a relationship, gifts, surprises, plans, date nights are unimportant them. Their partner may very much need these things which doesn’t mean well for INTPs if they can’t satisfy their partner’s needs.</p><p>
•	INTPs are notoriously bad at picking up on others’ emotional needs.
