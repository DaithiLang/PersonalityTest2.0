  <div class="strength"><hr><p3>Strengths:</p3><hr></div>
<p2>•	Dedicated </p2><p>
o	 Seeing things to completion borders on an ethical obligation for ESTJs. Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring – people with the ESTJ personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do.
</p><p2>•	Strong-willed </p2><p>
o	 A strong will makes this dedication possible, and ESTJs don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. ESTJs defend their ideas and principles relentlessly and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.
</p><p2>•	Direct and Honest </p2><p>
o	 ESTJs trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and ESTJ personalities return the honesty (whether it’s wanted or not).
</p><p2>•	Loyal, Patient and Reliable </p2><p>
o	 ESTJs work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When ESTJs say they’ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies and communities.
</p><p2>•	Enjoy Creating Order </p2><p>
o	 Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can’t be trusted when they are needed most – with this in mind, ESTJs strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures and clear roles.
</p><p2>•	Excellent Organizers </p2><p>
o	 This commitment to truth and clear standards makes ESTJs capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.

</p><div class="weakness"><hr>
  <p3>Weaknesses:</p3><hr></div><p2>
•	Inflexible and Stubborn </p2><p>
o	 The problem with being so fixated on what works is that ESTJs too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and ESTJ personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.
</p><p2>•	Uncomfortable with Unconventional Situations </p2><p>
o	 ESTJs are strong adherents to tradition and when suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough and abandoning what has always worked before in favour of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.
</p><p2>•	Judgmental </p2><p>
o	 ESTJs have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. ESTJs’ compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there are two right ways to get things done. ESTJs do not hesitate to let these "deviants" know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.
</p><p2>•	Too Focused on Social Status </p2><p>
o	 ESTJs take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues and community and while difficult to admit, are very concerned with public opinion. ESTJs (especially Turbulent ones) can get so caught up in meeting others’ expectations that they fail to address their own needs.
</p><p2>•	Difficult to Relax –</p2><p>
o	This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult to cut loose and relax for risk of looking the fool, even in good fun.
</p><p2>•	Difficulty Expressing Emotion </p2><p>
o	This is all evidence of ESTJs’ greatest weakness: expressing emotions and feeling empathy. People with the ESTJ personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy, or of their sensitivity. A detour can be breathtakingly beautiful, a joy for the family, but ESTJs may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly.
