  <div class="strength"><hr><p3>Strengths:</p3><hr></div>
<p2>•	Efficient </p2><p>
o	 ENTJs see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the ENTJ personality type will root out such behaviour wherever they go.
</p><p2>•	Energetic </p2><p>
o	 Rather than finding this process taxing ENTJs are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.
</p><p2>•	Self-Confident </p2><p>
o	 ENTJs couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.
</p><p2>•	Strong-Willed </p2><p>
o	Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – ENTJ personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.
</p><p2>•	Strategic Thinkers </p2><p>
o	 ENTJs exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.
</p><p2>•	Charismatic and Inspiring </p2><p>
o	These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps ENTJs to accomplish their often-ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.

</p><div class="weakness"><hr>
  <p3>Weaknesses:</p3><hr></div><p2>
•	Stubborn and Dominant</p2><p> 
o	 Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and ENTJs are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.
</p><p2>•	Intolerant </p2><p>
o	 "It’s my way or the highway" – People with the ENTJ personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. ENTJs won’t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.
</p><p2>•	Impatient </p2><p>
o	 Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking ENTJs. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.
</p><p2>•	Arrogant </p2><p>
o	 ENTJ personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right but will seem so beside overbearing ENTJs.
</p><p2>•	Poor Handling of Emotions </p2><p>
o	 All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes ENTJs distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.
</p><p2>•	Cold and Ruthless </p2><p>
o	 Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes ENTJs incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.

</p>
<div class="career"><hr><p3>Career Paths</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	ENTJs boldness and drive are truly best suited toward being a respected leader of an organisation or team, and no other personality type enjoys it quite as much.
</p><p>•	ENTJs don’t hold back when they are in the leadership role, if someone gets sloppy or holds things back with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, they will not hesitate to come down on them hard.
</p><p>•	Make excellent – corporate strategists, lawyers and judges, managers, CEOs and university professors.
</p><p>•	It takes time for their skills to be recognised and being low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and deeply unhappy. The crave for leadership and responsibility is beyond measure and ENTJs will make it to that leadership position, in time.
</p>
<div class="relationship"><hr><p3>Relationships</p3><hr></div>
<p>•	Take a leading role in relationships, using their enthusiasm and impressive energy.
</p><p>•	ENTJs put a lot of energy into their relationship.
</p><p>•	Their eyes are always on the long term, if they feel like dead end is in sight then they’ll cut their losses and move on in what will seem to their partner an abrupt end to the attention they had been receiving.
</p><p>•	Sensing others’ feelings and emotions will never be a comfortable skill for ENTJs. ENTJs continue to impress with their creativity and energy throughout the dating phase and future.
</p><p>•	Their authentic confidence makes ENTJs’ sex life dynamic to say the least and they often push to explore new ways to express their affection.
</p><p>•	ENTJs are extremely growth-oriented, and will seize any opportunity to improve themselves, listening to and acting on criticisms, so long they are logical ones.
</p><p>•	Avoidance of emotional support and growth.
</p><p>•	Best suited towards other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits to create more balance in the relationship.
